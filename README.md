# Moncash Serverless Payment Service

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a serverless payment service that utilizes various AWS services and the [Moncashify library](https://pypi.org/project/moncash/) to enable seamless online payments. The primary components of this service include:

- **Serverless Framework**: The service is built using the Serverless Framework, which allows for easy deployment and scaling of serverless applications. This framework streamlines the development process and leverages AWS services like AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

- **AWS DynamoDB**: Amazon DynamoDB is used to store and manage payment-related data, such as transaction records, user information, and payment history. DynamoDB provides a highly scalable, NoSQL database solution for efficient data storage.

- **AWS Lambda**: AWS Lambda is employed to run serverless functions that handle various aspects of the payment process, such as processing payment requests, managing user accounts, and verifying transactions. Lambda functions are event-driven and can be triggered by various events, ensuring a responsive payment system.

- **AWS API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway is utilized to create and manage RESTful APIs that enable communication between clients and the serverless functions. It serves as the entry point for external requests and ensures security, authentication, and rate limiting.

- **Moncashify Library**: The [Moncashify library](https://pypi.org/project/moncash/) is integrated into the service to enable Moncash payment processing. This library simplifies the interaction with the Moncash payment gateway and allows for seamless integration into your application.
